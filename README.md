# About the project
I developed this project entirely by cell phone because I miss programming, since my computer burned. Some systems were inspired by some others, but everything was done my way and as I could. You can use whatever you want from my repository, but it would be really cool if you gave it a star or create a fork as a way to credit ~my poor~ work. Test before using, I do not guarantee to be error free.
